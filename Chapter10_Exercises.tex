\item 
Search the literature for current applications of 3D seismic wave simulations in your domain of interest. Discuss the computational setup (mesh type, mesh size, regular vs. irregular) in connection with the specific numerical method employed. Is this the optimal method for the problem? How was the accuracy of the method verified? Would the results be fully reproducible?
